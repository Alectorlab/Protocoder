      <p>
        Code with Moto is easy to get started. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a little pop-up to show you where to navigate to get started. Make sure your Android device is on the same network as your computer. Open a web browser to that URL and you'll see a fully-featured editor interface.

        This web IDE is connected directly to your application where you can create new projects, edit existing ones, see live console output, view documentation, and more.
