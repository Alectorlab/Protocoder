					<h2> Introduction </h2>

					<p> Medialab-Prado is a program of the Department of Arts of the City Council of Madrid (Spain), aimed at the production, research, and dissemination of digital culture and of the area where art, science, technology, and society intersect.
						One of the sides of the building is totally covered with a mediafacade facing a public square  ,located in the art neighborhood of Madrid, where hundreds of people are engaged with the content displayed in it. The media facade only shows cultural content therefore commercial information is not allowed. </p>

            <h2> Huge size, low resolution </h2>
    					<span style="float:left; display:block"> <p>
    				In despite of the physical size of the façade (15x10 meters), it's resolution could be considered low, just 192x157 nodes. To correctly visualize content on it, it is necessary to adapt it to the size in nodes and take into account the shape of the façade.

    					<p> So basically your sketch will be low resolution 192x168 but each pixel will be huge and vibrant! It's pretty awesome to watch it! </p>

						<h2> Processing and Processing.js </h2>
						<p> <a href ="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions. Initially developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context, Processing also has evolved into a tool for generating finished professional work. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.</p>	

						<p> We use the Web (javascript) version of Processing, called <a href="www.processingjs.org"> Processing.js </a> to create the sketches. So the cool part is that you don't need to install anything in your computer, just start coding and  </p>

				<h2> Color tips </h2>
					<p>The facade is located in the core of the city, lots of people see the building everyday, and there is lots of neighbors living around the Medialab Prado. 
						For that reason we would recommend you to design your sketch using eye-friendly colors and non-schizophrenic movements ;) 
						
						Try to avoid big spaces with white & yellows and the friendly people of Madrid will thank you so much! :)
					</p>

					<h2> Interaction </h2>
					<p>On top of the building we have a CCV camera pointing to the square in front of the building. This camera is not used to record people's privacy! just to create cool interactions among people and the facade. We analyze the video for you, so you dont have to do overcomplicated signal processing. Just add few lines to the code you will get the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection">blobs</a> that will interact with your sketch!
						To start with this, click EXAMPLES on the toolbar above and choose Tracking, you will start with a workable code.</p>
