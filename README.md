AndroidApp
==========
The application is divided in three parts at the moment. A Server + Interface, the AppRunner which runs the scripts and a SharedLibraries folder. 
The reason for having two apps at the moment is that we are using the WebView UI component to run the apps, which is not ideal and might produces many force closes if the script is not written propertly. 
DesktopApp
Future simple app made using Nodewebkit + HTML5 that installs and manages your device

CodeEditor
The code editor, at the moment just a place holder
