If port 8080 is busy currently we dont get an error message..

LauncherActivity:
-----------------
* Should we pick a new name for the app. Make with Moto is ok?
* Do you like the animation from splash to the main screen?
* NFC supported? What are we doing with it?  
* 		setFullScreen();
		setHideHomeBar(); 
		both these are defined in the BaseActivity Class, do they belong there or in some utilities
		could be used by multiple activities to hide notification bar and make it full screen
		
* Is this app meant to run only on MAKR phones?	if not, we need to make sure we don't attempt to toggle gpio
  pins to power on the Serial line. Nothing happens but u get an error on the console.


MainActivity:
-------------
* MainActivity is extending BaseActivity...need to check what functionality does Base Activity provide..
can it be reused?

* check if ServiceConnection needs to be cleaned up while closing the app

* Why have a dummy MainApp..why not just have the Base Application here
