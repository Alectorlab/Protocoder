Gopi:
Add Motorola Copyright & License on top of each file

LauncherActivity:
-----------------
* Should we pick a new name for the app. Make with Moto is ok?
* Is the Splash timer too long? currently its 2 seconds? I suppose u could touch the screen anytime to exit splash
so this looks good actually!!!
* Do you like the animation from splash to the main screen?
* NFC supported? What are we doing with it?  
* What is the purpose of BaseActivity
* 		setFullScreen();
		setHideHomeBar(); 
		both these are defined in the BaseActivity Class, do they belong there or in some utilities
		could be used by multiple activities to hide notification bar and make it full screen
		
* Is this app meant to run only on MAKR phones?	if not, we need to make sure we don't attempt to toggle gpio
  pins to power on the Serial line. Nothing happens but u get an error on the console.
* Do we need to put the MemoryLogger inside a DEBUG condition. Well doesnt matter really


MainActivity:
-------------
@SuppressLint("NewApi")  : What does this do..what happens without it?
